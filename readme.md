## SELF-BALANCING BINARY TREE

An implementation of an AVL-tree, a self-balancing binary tree, in Golang.

<mark>This code is not well tested, and should not be used in production code.</mark>

Original code comes from [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-implementation-in-golang/) 
article, but I have added generics and my code uses methods instead of functions.

# TODO

* Needs way more tests to make sure that this implementation works
